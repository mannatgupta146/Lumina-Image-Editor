## Features

### 🎨 Adjustable Filters

Lumina provides 9 powerful and intuitive filters to transform your images. Each filter is adjustable via interactive sliders with real-time preview. All adjustments are non-destructive—your original image remains unchanged.

| Filter           | Range | Unit | Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brightness**   | 0-200 | %    | Adjust overall brightness. Tip: Use 110-120% to fix underexposed photos.                            |
| **Contrast**     | 0-200 | %    | Control light and dark differences. Tip: Combine with saturation at 120% for vibrant look.          |
| **Saturation**   | 0-200 | %    | Adjust color intensity. 0% = grayscale, 200% = hyper-saturated. Tip: Use 130% for social media.     |
| **Hue Rotation** | 0-360 | deg  | Rotate colors around the wheel. Tip: 180 degrees inverts colors, 20-40 degrees shifts warm to cool. |
| **Blur**         | 0-20  | px   | Apply Gaussian blur for softness. Tip: Combine with reduced contrast for portraits.                 |
| **Grayscale**    | 0-200 | %    | Convert to shades of gray. Tip: 100% = classic B&W, 50% = muted tones.                              |
| **Sepia**        | 0-200 | %    | Add warm, brownish vintage tones. Tip: Combine with 70% grayscale for authentic vintage.            |
| **Invert**       | 0-200 | %    | Reverse colors for negative effect. Tip: Combine with hue rotation for surreal effects.             |
| **Opacity**      | 0-100 | %    | Control transparency. Tip: Use 30-50% for watermark protection.                                     |

## Tips & Tricks for Better Editing 💡

**Power Trio** - Brightness +10-20% + Contrast +15-25% + Saturation +10-30% = Professional results

**Soft Look** - Apply preset + Blur 2-4px + Reduce Contrast 10% + Add Sepia 5-10%

**HDR Look** - Boost Contrast +30% + Saturation +40% + Brightness +15%

**By Scenario:**

- Dark photos: Brightness +20-30%, Contrast +15-20%, Saturation +10-15%
- Bright photos: Brightness -10-15%, Contrast +15-25%, Saturation -10%
- Flat photos: Saturation +20-40%, Contrast +20-30%
- Color shift: Use Hue Rotation 5-15 degrees to adjust warm/cool tones

## Troubleshooting 🔧

| Issue                               | Solution                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Image not showing**               | Check file format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) - Verify file isn't corrupted - Try different image - Clear browser cache |
| **Filters are slow**                | Use smaller image - Close other browser tabs - Update browser - Large images (>8MP) may lag                       |
| **Preset highlighting not visible** | Use modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) - Click another preset then back - Try page refresh            |
| **Export creates blank file**       | Ensure image is uploaded - Reset filters then reapply - Use different image - Check download permissions          |
| **Filters have no effect**          | Normal for subtle filters - Try max slider values - Combine with other filters                                    |
| **Can't undo changes**              | Click **Reset** to restore all filters instantly - No multi-level undo, but one-click reset always available      |

## Performance 🚀

- **Lightweight** - Only ~50KB total (minified), super fast page load
- **No Dependencies** - Zero npm packages = instant load, no waiting
- **GPU Accelerated** - Canvas filters use GPU for silky smooth 60+ FPS
- **Real-time Processing** - Typically <16ms per frame (that's 60+ times per second)
- **Memory Efficient** - Single canvas rendering, no memory leaks
- **Works Offline** - No internet needed after initial page load
- **Optimized for Desktop/Tablet** - Best experience on larger screens

## How It Works

### Image Processing Architecture

Lumina uses the **HTML5 Canvas API** combined with modern CSS filters to deliver real-time image processing:

**Processing Pipeline:**

1. User uploads an image via the file input
2. Image is loaded into a canvas element (HTML5 Canvas)
3. Filter adjustments trigger real-time re-rendering
4. Canvas `filter` property applies all active filters simultaneously
5. Image preview updates instantly (typically within 16ms)
6. User can download the final result as PNG

**Performance Optimization:**

- Filters use native browser APIs (no heavy computation)
- Real-time processing at 60+ frames per second on modern browsers
- Minimal memory footprint with efficient DOM manipulation
- Lazy loading of preset data

## Known Limitations 📋

- **Desktop/Tablet Optimized** - Best experience on larger screens; smaller mobile screens may feel cramped
- **Large Images** - Images >8MP may show lag on older devices or with all filters maxed out
- **Export Quality** - Canvas rendering quality depends on browser capabilities and system hardware
- **Filter Precision** - Some very subtle adjustments may not be visible at small preview scales
- **Browser Specific** - Major browsers fully supported, older browsers (IE11) not supported
- **No Multi-Undo** - Reset clears all changes at once (but you always have one-click reset)

## Future Enhancements 🔮

Potential features for future versions:

- **Crop & Resize** - Built-in image cropping and resizing tools
- **Layers & Compositing** - Multiple layers with blend modes
- **Undo/Redo History** - Full edit history with step-by-step navigation
- **Before/After Comparison** - Side-by-side or split view comparisons
- **Advanced Filters** - Sharpen, Curves, Levels, Highlights/Shadows
- **Color Grading** - Professional color wheels and curves adjustments
- **Mobile App** - Dedicated mobile app for iOS/Android
- **Batch Processing** - Apply presets to multiple images at once
- **Preset Sharing** - Share custom presets with community
- **RAW Support** - Import and edit RAW camera files
- **Metadata Preservation** - EXIF data handling for professional workflows
